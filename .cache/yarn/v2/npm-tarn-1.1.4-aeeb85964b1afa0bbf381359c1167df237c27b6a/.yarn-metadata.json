Tarn has timeouts for all operations\nthat can fail or timeout so that you should never end up with pool full of crap. Tarn has a comprehensive\ntest suite and we are committed to adding tests and fixing all bugs that are found.\n\nTarn will always remain simple.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install tarn\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst { Pool, TimeoutError } = require('tarn');\n\nconst pool = new Pool({\n\n  // function that creates a resource. You can either pass the resource\n  // to the callback or return a promise that resolves the resource\n  // (but not both).\n  create: (cb) => {\n    cb(null, new SomeResource());\n  },\n\n  // validates a connection before it is used. Return true or false\n  // from it. If false is returned, the resource is destroyed and a\n  // another one is acquired.\n  validate: (resource) {\n    return true;\n  },\n\n  // function that destroys a resource. This is always synchronous\n  // as nothing waits for the return value.\n  destroy: (someResource) => {\n    someResource.cleanup();\n  },\n\n  // minimum size\n  min: 2,\n\n  // maximum size\n  max: 10,\n\n  // acquire promises are rejected after this many milliseconds\n  // if a resource cannot be acquired\n  acquireTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n\n  // create operations are cancelled after this many milliseconds\n  // if a resource cannot be acquired\n  createTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n\n  // free resouces are destroyed after this many milliseconds\n  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,\n\n  // how often to check for idle resources to destroy\n  reapIntervalMillis: 1000,\n\n  // long long to idle after failed create before trying again\n  createRetryIntervalMillis: 200,\n\n  // If true, when a create fails, the first pending acquire is\n  // rejected with the error. If this is false (the default) then\n  // create is retried until acquireTimeoutMillis milliseconds has\n  // passed.\n  propagateCreateError: false\n});\n\n// acquires a resource. The promise is rejected with `tarn.TimeoutError`\n// after `acquireTimeoutMillis` if a resource could not be acquired.\nconst acquire = pool.acquire();\n\n// acquire can be aborted using the abort method\nacquire.abort();\n\n// the acquire object has a promise property that gets reolved with\n// the acquired resource\ntry {\n  const resource = await acquire.promise;\n} catch (err) {\n  // if the acquire times out an error of class TimeoutError is thrown\n  if (err instanceof TimeoutError) {\n    console.log('timeout');\n  }\n}\n\n// releases the resource.\npool.release(resource);\n\n// returns the number of non-free resources\npool.numUsed()\n\n// returns the number of free resources\npool.numFree()\n\n// how many acquires are waiting for a resource to be released\npool.numPendingAcquires()\n\n// how many asynchronous create calls are running\npool.numPendingCreates()\n\n// waits for all resources to be returned to the pool and destroys them.\n// pool cannot be used after this.\nawait pool.destroy();\n```\n",
