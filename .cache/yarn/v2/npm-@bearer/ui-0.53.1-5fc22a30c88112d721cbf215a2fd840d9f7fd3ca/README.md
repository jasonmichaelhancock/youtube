## Development

At the moment, we are using the demo folder to develop/update/create UI components.
We are doing this because we did not spent time on node_modules reloading. 
By creating a symlink in demo from ui components folder we take advantage of hot reloading. It also give us a Stencil context 

Follow the instructions (here)[./demo] to setup the development environment. 

You can then start creating updating components.
