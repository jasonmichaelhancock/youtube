    "readme": "# level-fix-range\n\nmake reverse ranges easier to use.\n\n## Stability\n\nStable: Expect patches, possible features additions.\n\n## Example\n\nWhen you use reverse ranges, you have to reverse the `start` and `end` also,\n\n``` js\ndb.createReadStream({start: 'a', end: 'z'})\ndb.createReadStream({start: 'z', end: 'a', reverse: true})\n```\n\nthis is confusing and bug-ridden.\n\nlevel-fix-range fixes the options so they always make sense.\nif you want a range to reverse, just set reverse.\n\n``` js\nvar fix = require('level-fix-range')\ndb.createReadStream({start: 'a', end: 'z'})\ndb.createReadStream(fix({start: 'a', end: 'z', reverse: true}))\n```\n\nWhen you either `start` _OR_ `end`, and the order is `reversed: true`,\nit will also reverse the range,\nso that:\n\n``` js\n{start: X, end: null} //from X to end of database\n{start: null, end: X} //from start of database to X\n```\nand you will get the some data, whether you have reverse=true|false,\nbut only the order will change.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
